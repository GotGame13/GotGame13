👋 Hello GitHub community!
I’m @GotGame13, a gaming and electronics enthusiast. 
(As well as a basketball finatic & HUGE Phx Suns fan.)

- 👀 I’m interested in website design, coding, and building
or modifying electronics. Primary Android
and Windows devices. 
I'm hoping to advance my knowledge and gain fundamental 
insights into the rapidly growing world of cyber-securiry.
Both for fun and avoiding becoming a victim. 🤞

🌱 I’m slowly learning but and pieces of the basics. 
I've also encountered "coders" of the malicious,
pitifully relentless variety too.
💞️ I know most of this community isn't like that though. 

I’m looking to collaborate on fun projects, 
learn more about coding, building, and security.
Perhaps interact with the kinder, more passionate,
considerite side of this community as well.

- 📫 How to reach me... Message me here or shoot me an
Email @ NoDunksValley@pm.me!
If your willing to be a bit patience with 
my less than adept skillset, I'm eager to
learn and would be very grateful to anyone willing to
 share their time & knowledge!!
To anyone reading, Have an amazing day! 😊👍
